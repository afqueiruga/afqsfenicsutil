## Intro 

A little collections of utilities for FEniCS. Portions of it are taken from
various codes by afq and  B.E. Abali. We use it for many different
applications. Most notably, the algorithm in
[mesh_morph.py](mesh_morph.py) is a crucial component to an upcoming
paper:

> Theory and computation of electromagnetic fields and thermomechanical structure interaction for systems undergoing large deformations

which is available a [https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10551](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10551). The repository implementing that theory is [https://github.com/afqueiruga/EMSI-2018](https://github.com/afqueiruga/EMSI-2018).
